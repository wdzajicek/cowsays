# Cowsays

A simplified Node.js based cowsay CLI with zero external dependencies.

```bash
$ cowsays "hello
there
bob,
how is it going????"
 ---------------------
/ hello               \
| there               |
| bob,                |
\ how is it going???? /
 ---------------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

## Project Requirements/Goals

* Node.js CLI that can take either command arguments or piped input from another command
* Zero dependencies â€” use Node.js with zero external packages
* Simplified version of cowsay:
  * Only does the default cowsay cow (`default.cow` from the original cowsay)
  * No changing eyes, tongue, or thought bubbles

## Installation

Use the Node.js version specified in project's `.nvmrc` file.

**Note:** command used is `cowsays` (with an "s") to not interfere with original `cowsay` command if installed.

```bash
git clone <>
cd cowsays
npm i -g .
```

## Usage

```bash
# Pass input as command line argument:
$ cowsays 'Hello, World!'
 ---------------
< Hello, World! >
 ---------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||

# Pipe input from another command:
$ echo 'Hello, World!' | cowsays
 ---------------
< Hello, World! >
 ---------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```
